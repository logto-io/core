## Sign-in Experience v2

We are thrilled to announce the release of the newest version of the Sign-in Experience, which includes more ways to sign-in and sign-up, as well as a framework that is easier to understand and more flexible to configure in the Admin Console.

When compared to Sign-in Experience v1, this versionâ€™s capability was expanded so that it could support a greater variety of flexible use cases. For example, now users can sign up with email verification code and sign in with email and password.

We hope that this will be able to assist developers in delivering a successful sign-in flow, which will also be appreciated by the end users.
