introduce Logto Organizations

The term "organization" is also used in other forms, such as "workspace", "team", "company", etc. In Logto, we use "organization" as the generic term to represent the concept of multi-tenancy.

From now, you can create multiple organizations in Logto, each of which can have its own users, while in the same identity pool.

Plus, we also introduce the concept of "organization template". It is a set of permissions and roles that applies to all organizations, while a user can have different roles in different organizations.

See [üè¢ Organizations (Multi-tenancy)](https://docs.logto.io/docs/recipes/organizations/) for more details.
