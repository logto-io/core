New feature: User account settings page

- We have removed the previous settings page and moved it to the account settings page. You can access to the new settings menu by clicking the user avatar in the top right corner.
- You can directly change the language or theme from the popover menu, and explore more account settings by clicking the "Profile" menu item.
- You can update your avatar, name and username in the profile page, and also changing your password.
- [Cloud] Cloud users can also link their email address and social accounts (Google and GitHub at first launch).
