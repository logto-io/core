### Simplify the terms of use and privacy policy manual agreement steps for the sign-in flow

The Terms of Use and Privacy Policy manuel agreement are now removed from the sign-in flow.

- The changes may take effect on all the existing sign-in flows, including password sign-in, social sign-in, and verification-code sign-in.
- The agreement checkbox in sign-in pages is now replaced with links to the Terms of Use and Privacy Policy pages. Users can still read the agreements before signing in.
- The manual agreement steps are still mandatory for the sign-up flow. Users must agree to the Terms of Use and Privacy Policy before signing up a new account. Including sign-up with new social identities. The agreement checkbox in sign-up pages remain still.
