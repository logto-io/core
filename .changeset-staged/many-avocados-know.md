## Smart Identifier Input designed to streamline your sign-in experience

We have integrated the traditional input fields for username, phone number, and email into a single intelligent input box. This advanced input box automatically identifies the type of characters youâ€™re entering, such as an @ sign or consecutive numbers, and provides relevant error feedback. By streamlining the sign-in process, users no longer need to waste time figuring out which button to click to switch their desired login method. This reduces the risk of errors and ensures a smoother sign-in experience.
