 * A tag that indicates whether a feature is in beta or requires a paid plan.
 *
 * - **For beta tags**: The tag will always be visible.
 * - **For paid plan tags**: The tag will be visible if `isVisible` is `true`, which means that
 * the tenant's subscription plan has no access to the feature (paywall). However, it will always
 * be visible for dev tenants since they have access to almost all features, and it's useful for
 * developers to know which features need to be paid for in production.
 *
 * CAUTION: You should only render this component when the feature has a paywall.
 *
 * @example
 * Use as a beta tag:
 *
 * ```tsx
 * <FeatureTag for="beta" />
 * ```
 *
 * Use as a paid plan tag:
 *
 * ```tsx
 * // In a production tenant, the tag will be visible when there's no access to the feature
 * <FeatureTag for="upsell" isVisible={noAccessToFeature} plan="pro" />
 *
 * // In a dev tenant, the tag will always be visible even if `isVisible` is `false`
 * <FeatureTag for="upsell" isVisible={false} plan="pro" />
 *
 * // For conditionally rendering the tag, usually in an iteration on a list which contains
 * // both free and paid features
 * {features.map((feature) => (
 *   hasPaywall(feature) &&
 *     <FeatureTag for="upsell" isVisible={hasAccess(feature)} plan="hobby" />
 * ))}
 * ```
