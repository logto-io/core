# Logto [WIP]

ðŸ¤˜ Logto[^info] helps you quickly focus on everything after signing in.

**Main Features**

- An OIDC-based identity service
- Multi-platform user sign-in/up experience with dark mode and SDKs (Web, iOS, and Android)
- Sign-in/up with dynamic SMS/Email passcode
- Out-of-box social sign-in integration (GitHub, Google, WeChat, Alipay, etc.)
- A web UI to control all above (Admin Console)
- Extendable multi-language support

Boringly, we call it "[customer identity access management](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Customer_identity_access_management)" (CIAM) or "customer identity solution."
